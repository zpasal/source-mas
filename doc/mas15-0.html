<p><tt>Version 2, June 1991</tt>
<p><tt>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</tt>
<br><tt>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA</tt>
<p><tt>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</tt>
<br><tt>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</tt>
<p><tt>Preamble</tt>
<br><tt>========</tt>
<p><tt>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.&nbsp; (Some other
Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to your programs, too.</tt>
<p><tt>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</tt>
<p><tt>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&nbsp;</tt>
<p><tt>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</tt>
<p><tt>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</tt>
<p><tt>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp;
If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations.</tt>
<p><tt>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.&nbsp;
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.&nbsp;
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed
for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</tt>
<p><tt>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.</tt>
<p><b><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
AND MODIFICATION</tt></b>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the terms of this General Public
License.&nbsp; The "Program",</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below, refers to any such program or work,
and a "work based on</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program" means either the Program
or any derivative work under</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; translated into another language.&nbsp;
(Hereinafter, translation is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; included without limitation in the term
"modification".)&nbsp; Each</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; licensee is addressed as "you".</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution
and modification are</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.&nbsp; The act</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of running the Program is not restricted,
and the output from the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program (independent of having been
made by running the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends
on what the Program does.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notices that refer to this License and
to the absence of any</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warranty; and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License along with the Program.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act
of transferring a copy,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a fee.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distribute such modifications or work
under the terms of Section 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above, provided that you also meet all
of these conditions:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. You must cause the modified
files to carry prominent notices</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. You must cause any work
that you distribute or publish, that</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all third
parties under the terms of this License.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. If the modified program
normally reads commands interactively</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; program
under these conditions, and telling the user how to</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; view a copy
of this License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement,
your work based on the Program is not required</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to print
an announcement.)</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These requirements apply to the modified
work as a whole.&nbsp; If</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works.&nbsp; But when you distribute the
same sections as part of a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole which is a work based on the Program,
the distribution of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it is not the intent of this section
to claim rights or</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contest your rights to work written entirely
by you; rather, the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intent is to exercise the right to control
the distribution of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; derivative or collective works based on
the Program.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, mere aggregation of another
work not based on the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program with the Program (or with a work
based on the Program) on</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other work under the scope of this License.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
you also do one of the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code,
which must be distributed under the terms of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software
interchange; or,</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Accompany it with a written
offer, valid for at least three</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable
copy of the corresponding source code, to be</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Accompany it with the information
you received as to the offer</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute
corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received
the program in object code or executable form with</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such an
offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The source code for a work means the preferred
form of the work for</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making modifications to it.&nbsp; For
an executable work, complete</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as a special exception, the source
code distributed need</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If distribution of executable or object
code is made by offering</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access to copy the source code from the
same place counts as</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distribution of the source code, even
though third parties are not</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compelled to copy the source along with
the object code.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except as expressly provided under this
License.&nbsp; Any attempt</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
or distribute the Program is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; However, parties who have
received copies, or rights,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from you under this License will not have
their licenses</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terminated so long as such parties remain
in full compliance.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you
have not</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or distribute the Program or its derivative
works.&nbsp; These actions</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to do so, and all its terms and
conditions for copying,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributing or modifying the Program
or works based on it.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original licensor to copy, distribute
or modify the Program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp;
You may not impose any</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; granted herein.&nbsp; You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by third parties to this License.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
of patent</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if
a patent license would not permit</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; royalty-free redistribution of the Program
by all those who</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entirely from distribution of the Program.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any portion of this section is held
invalid or unenforceable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intended to apply and the section as a
whole is intended to apply</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in other circumstances.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the purpose of this section to
induce you to infringe any</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented by public license practices.&nbsp;
Many people have made</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generous contributions to the wide range
of software distributed</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system; it is up to the author/donor to
decide if he or she is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; willing to distribute software through
any other system and a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; licensee cannot impose that choice.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section is intended to make thoroughly
clear what is believed</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be a consequence of the rest of this
License.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain countries either by patents or
by copyrighted interfaces,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original copyright holder who places
the Program under this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excluding those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in or among countries not thus excluded.&nbsp;
In such case, this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License incorporates the limitation as
if written in the body of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; versions of the General Public License
from time to time.&nbsp; Such</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing
version number.&nbsp; If the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program specifies a version number of
this License which applies</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the terms and conditions either of that
version or of any later</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version published by the Free Software
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programs whose distribution conditions
are different, write to the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For
software which is copyrighted</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Free Software Foundation, write
to the Free Software</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this.&nbsp; Our decision</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and reuse of software generally.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NO WARRANTY</b></tt>
<p><b><tt>&nbsp;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
IS NO</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

<p><tt>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</tt>
<br><tt>=============================================</tt>
<p><tt>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</tt>
<p><tt>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It
is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND
A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) 19YY&nbsp; NAME OF AUTHOR</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can
redistribute it and/or modify</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License as published by</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version
2 of the License, or</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope
that it will be useful,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even
the implied warranty of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the
GNU General Public License</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write
to the Free Software</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite
330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.</tt>
<p><tt>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.</tt>
<p><tt>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY
NAME OF AUTHOR</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;
for details</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type `show w'.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.</tt>
<p><tt>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</tt>
<p><tt>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers)
written by James Hacker.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ty Coon, President of Vice</tt>
<p><tt>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.</tt>
